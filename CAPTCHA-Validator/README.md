# CAPTCHA-Validator

## Overview
The CAPTCHA-Validator project demonstrates how to implement CAPTCHA validation on a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a type of challenge-response test used in computing to determine whether the user is human. This project ensures that only human users can interact with the website, protecting it from bots and automated abuse.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the CAPTCHA input and the surrounding web page.
- **CSS**: Styles the CAPTCHA form and its elements, ensuring a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the logic for generating the CAPTCHA challenge and validating the user's response.

## Features
1. **Dynamic CAPTCHA Generation**: Each time the page is loaded, a new CAPTCHA is generated to ensure uniqueness and security.
2. **Validation Mechanism**: JavaScript is used to validate the user's input against the generated CAPTCHA.
3. **User-Friendly Design**: CSS ensures that the CAPTCHA and form elements are styled for a pleasant user experience.
4. **Accessibility**: The CAPTCHA is designed to be accessible, ensuring that users with disabilities can still complete the challenge.
